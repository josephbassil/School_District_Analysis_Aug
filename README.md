# School_District_Analysis_Aug
##Overview of the school district analysis:
we are analyzing school districts, creating a summary based on math, reading and overall passing scores and percentages,showing high and low performing schools based and grouping our results by school spending, school size and type.
Then we are going through the same process after replacing THS 9th grades with NaN to be able to identify any major changes and make sure no alteration to grades has been made

###Purpose:
file shows evidence of academic dishonesty; specifically, reading and math grades for Thomas High School ninth graders appear to have been altered, we should repeat the school district analysis that we did in this module and write up a report to describe how these changes affected the overall analysis.

###Results:
###Summary:four changes to the school district analysis after reading and math scores have been replaced:
1- percentage of students who passe both math and reading: 
1st analysis: 65.172
2nd analysis: 64.855
